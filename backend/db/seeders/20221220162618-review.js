Every window and every angle is/has an amazing view of the hills and the ocean. The home is very spacious and great for having guests over for dinner. Katherine (host) and her family are very friendly, super helpful, and great at ongoing communication. We will definitely stay here again in the future. It's a great place to bring your well-behaved furry friend as well.",
